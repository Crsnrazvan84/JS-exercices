    <p>32. Write a JavaScript program to find a value which is nearest to 100 from two different given integer values. </p>
    <p>Enter 1st mber: <input type="number" id="input1" oninput="check()"></p>
    <p>Enter 2nd number: <input type="number" id="input2" oninput="check()"></p>
    <p>The nearest number to 100 is: <span id="result"></span></p>

    

    <script>
        function check(){
            var a = document.getElementById("input1").value;
            aDiff = Math.abs(100 - a);
            console.log("adiff is " + aDiff);
            var b = document.getElementById("input2").value;
            bDiff = Math.abs(100 - b);
            console.log("bDiff is " + bDiff);

            if (aDiff === bDiff){
                document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Both numbers are equally near to 100!"
            }else if(aDiff < bDiff){
                document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = a;
            }else if(aDiff > bDiff){
                document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = b;
            }
