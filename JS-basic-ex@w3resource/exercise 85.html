        85. Write a JavaScript code to divide an given array of positive integers into two parts. First element goes to
        first part, second element goes to second part, and third element goes to first part and so on. Now compute the
        sum of two parts and store into an array of size two.

        open console

    <script>
        const divideArray = arr => {
            let even = 0;
            let odd = 0;
            arr.forEach(element => arr.indexOf(element) % 2 == 0 ? even += element: odd += element);
            const finalArray = [even, odd];
            console.log(finalArray);
        }

        divideArray([1, 3, 6, 2, 5, 10])
